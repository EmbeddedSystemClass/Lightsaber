# Lightsaber

●Created a functional lightsaber with the following features:
-Turned on via a "jedi-like" arm swing pointing the lightsaber towards the ground
-The color of the lightsaber changed (blue, red, green, and purple) through the use of a button
-A mode that enabled the lightsaber to change colors as lightsaber was tilted. This was accomplished through the use of an embedded computer board, an accelerometer, and an RGB light strip
